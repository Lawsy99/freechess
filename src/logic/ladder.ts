// The club ladder (Joseph, Sep 2026): everyone at the club by rating, with
// the player among them. Fixed members (and the background members) stay
// put, so the player climbs past them for good. The main cast who scale sit
// a set distance from the player, chosen by the story, so they're overtaken
// only at story moments (and Toby never is). Ratings are the ones they play at
// right now: the week's person and cup opponents are near your level that week
// (clubRating), so the ladder shifts a little week to week, as a real one does.
