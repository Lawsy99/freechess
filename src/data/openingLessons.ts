// Opening lessons (Joseph, Sep 2026: "a lot of people aren't great at
// openings... where do I move my first few pieces"). Two simple, sound ways
// to start as White, each with the three ideas behind every opening: take
// the centre, get your pieces out, castle.
//
// Each has a worked demonstration, then a drill: you play the White moves,
// Pemberton plays Black (varying his replies), and a wrong move gets the
// principle it breaks, not just "no". Lines are checked for legality by
// src/logic/openingDrill.test.ts.
