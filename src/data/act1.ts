// Act 1, "Club nights": the fixed path from after trial night to the
// knockout cup final (design document, "The path" and "Stakes").
//
// Revised Sep 2026 (Joseph: more runway; the story can move slowly, the
// essence is playing chess). Sixteen weeks, four months: seven story weeks,
// each introducing someone, with ordinary club weeks between them where you
// play people you already know, so they become familiar. Then cup week.
//
// Story beats are in content/dialogue.csv (lines flagged "chapter:c1" and so
// on), data/weekStory.ts (each week's small moments) and data/cutscenes.ts;
// see docs/story-outline.md. Each week's coaching-night lesson is in
// lessons.ts (same id).
