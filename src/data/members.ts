// Background members of Wexley Chess Club (Joseph, Sep 2026): on the club
// ladder but not opponents (yet). Their ratings are set once after trial
// night and never change, and sit well away from the player's, so they give
// the ladder depth without crowding the main cast. The two above are
// long-term targets (and natural Act 2 ladder opponents).

// They're never labelled on screen (like everyone else). The player learns
// who they are from being mentioned or seen around the club: see
// content/dialogue.csv (lines mentioning them) and data/weekStory.ts.
