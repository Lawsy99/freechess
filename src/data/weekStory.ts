// - Tuesday and Thursday: one line each, "Around the club", on Home once that
//   night's session is done. Seen or overheard; never explained.
// - Saturday: "On the way out", once you've won the best of three: two or
//   three lines that close the week and open the next question.
//
// House style: understated, plain observation, no narrator, no em dashes.
